Economic Data Analysis with Python using Pandas

To run this project please make sure you have python installed and annconda also installed

Then run requirments.txt using the following command `pip install -r requirements.txt`


You can do this without creating an environment specific to the project or creating an environment for the project. However it is preferred to create an environment as it won't have any conflict issues with other projects of yours.

The code for creating a environment using conda is `conda create --name <env_name> python=<version> `

For this project I have used phython version 3.12.7 which is the latest version as of Dec 2024.

To activate the env the following code is used  `conda activate <env_name>`

To deactivate the env the following code is used `conda deactivate`
